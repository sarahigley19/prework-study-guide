Bootcamp Prework Study Guide for Students

## Description

The motivation of my pre-work study guide project was to learn how to use the terminal, gitHub and of course learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I built this project as a baseline to start my web developer bootcamp. By being able to figure out the prework, it will set me up in a good spot for the rest of this class.

My prework study guide solves some basic problems. It has taught me the basics of HTML and CSS -- the frame and the styling of the house, while also teaching me how to make "the house" functional. This pre-work has been very frustrating, but I have learned a lot along the way. It's been really hard, but rewarding.
